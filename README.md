This notebook is a recoding of the analysis used in the PLoSONE paper: [Non-Invasive Mapping of the Gastrointestinal Microbiota Identifies Children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0039242) using python, sklearn and pandas.
      
The SLiME package, as it was packaged for the publication of the paper, is not in the open anymore. In its place, this notebook will serve as a repository of the analysis. I hope this can be the starting point for others trying to follow the same approach and improve upon it.
